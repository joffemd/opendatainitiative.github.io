### GOVERNANCE
ODI is only as strong as the people participating and backing up its mission. A few of us meet at least monthly as a group of shared responsibility to manage ODI strategic decisions.

### MISSION
The Open Data Initiative exists to advance government financial transparency. Through resources, partners, and events, we inform the public and the government on the best open data solutions available. 

Implementing open data technology is much more than just making data available. For example, low quality published government data does not equal transparency. A modern government achieves transparency through open data published in a reporting format ready for data-driven decision making. Open Data Initiative and its partners track the government legislative and technology implementation of machine-readable reporting formats across the United States government.  We publish the results to inform the public and to provide insights for improvements to existing government open data implementations. 

However, even while armed with this valuable information, improvements to government open data implementations is a difficult, long term task. The skills and technology to make effective open data solutions possible is expensive and elusive. The good news is government wants to improve and be responsive to its constituents. Government understands by publishing high quality government data, the public can utilize data science for improvements. To meet this need, the Open Data Initiative and its partners are consistently improving their technology skills, tools, and resources. Find the impressive results of the government financial transparency community at the Open Data Initiative, where government, policy, and commercial organizations work together. Participate in person at Open Data Initiative events to learn about real world examples of modern government solutions and what is coming next.

ODI is administered through Lincoln Network, a 501(c)(3) nonprofit.
