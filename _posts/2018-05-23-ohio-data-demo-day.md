Sponsor a morning of talks and panels on 23 May 2018, dedicated to the Ohio open data success story at the Office of the Ohio Treasurer in partnership with local governments and schools. Their secret to success has been their dedication to relentless customer service. Expect notable government and policy speakers discussing how this focus on the customer has worked to set off a national race for greater transparency.

Ohio Bill GA132-HB3 defines a data board (named DataOhio) that would put into law the Office of the Ohio Treasurer's open data policies of the past 4 years. After the morning of talks, in the afternoon, we are going to hold an unofficial DataOhio meeting. This meeting is meant to not only bring attention to the need to pass GA132-HB3, but also outline how the DataOhio board would set standards and function. There is a long list of newspaper, township, city, and policy organizations that will be invited to both the morning and afternoon events. A partial list: Ohio Municipal League, Ohio Township Association, Ohio Association of School Business Officials, Buckeye Association of School Administrators, County Commissioner Association of Ohio, County Auditor Association of Ohio, Ohio Newspaper Association, Ohio Society of CPAs, and Common Cause Ohio. In addition, the Governor, State Treasurer, State Attorney General, Secretary of State, and State Auditor will also be invited.

The morning event will be held on or near the Ohio State House grounds, with the location details to be finalized shortly. We have space for two 20 minute talks and two 45 minute panels. Now that some of the major details have been finalized, we will utilize the invite list for speakers.

The afternoon meeting will be held at the State Library. 

Open Data Initiative, Data Coalition, Ohio Treasury, PIRG, Buckeye Institute, and Sunlight Foundation are co-organizing this event.

Registration will open soon.
