Preliminary details:
* 23 May 2018 is the target date for the event. Not confirmed yet as some details still need to be verified.
* Lots of ideas for locations to hold the event. We may be able to get space on the State Capital grounds.
* Morning focused on the Ohio Treasury Office approach to open data and the afternoon on the DataOhio board meeting
* We want to request Josh Mandell as the headline speaker
* We want to hold a non-official DataOhio board meeting in the afternoon. 
* Lots of ideas for sponsors. We will be each speaking with potential sponsors on their interest and reporting back to the group next week. Once we figure out the meeting space, will have sponsorship amounts we will need to go back to the sponsors with.
